# Assignment: Web Store Responsive Styling

## Overview

For this assignment, you will expand your previous assignment to complete the responsive layout styling for the already created product listing page `index.html`, as well as write and style `product.html` to present one (1) of your listed products. Your project will have at least three (3) CSS documents: `style.css` for site-wide styling and shared utility rules, `index.css` for style specific to **index.html** and `product.css` for style that's specific to **product.html**. 

## HTML Content and Architecture

Your new HTML page must be semantic, with rich, well thought-out content that meets the minimum criteria for a live e-commerce web store as discussed in class (information architecture, accessible content, etc). As done with the previous assignment, use similar published websites as inspiration for information architecture and general content (as well as other features if relevant). The pages should appear consistent in terms of look-and-feel, which means their content will have similar structure.

## CSS Styling and Layout

The pages will be graded in Chrome (both browser AND "device" mode) with testing in viewport widths ranging between 320px (minimum) to 1200px (though your site should obviously account for larger viewports). The site must be well structured when tested within all viewport sizes. Content should remain fluid and fill the entire width of the viewport for small screens, and should be managed to best represent the content for larger screens (meaning fluid width vs set width - depending on what's most appropriate given the content/layout). You will create at least two (2) breakpoints ("media queries"), meaning your site should have three (3) different layouts. 

## Other Criteria 

Naming classes can be difficult once a site begins to scale, review your css class names to ensure they are easy to scale (use established techniques like ["BEM"](http://getbem.com/naming/) if it helps you organize). Ensure your document is organized and that your media queries are at the bottom of their respective documents. Both pages (`index.html` and `product.html` should be in the root folder)

If it helps, review (or print) the following checklist before considering your Assignment complete (constantly being updated, so check back and reprint at the end, before submitting): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g05ZebXE2y6J6YL1O_8ADcHO-qkY6MH4K2vP7vZUUHk


## Submission

1. Name your project folder `yourlastname-yourfirstname-assignment-one`, zip the folder (be sure it has the same name with ".zip" at the end, **no "RAR" or other compressed formats will be accepted**). Ensure your images are no more than 300kb each, totalling no more than 2mb maximum together.
2. Attach the zip file to this submission using "browse my computer" and then "submit".
3. You are only able to submit to Blackboard once, so please ensure what you are submitting is your FINAL version. Submissions are NOT accepted by email.
