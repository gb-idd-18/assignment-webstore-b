# Assignment: Web Store Responsive Styling

## Overview

Complete the responsive styling for `index.html` completed in the previous project as well as creating `product.html` to present one of your products (your choice). Your new HTML page must be semantic, with rich, well thought-out content that meets the minimum criteria for a live e-commerce web store. Use existing sites as inspiration for content (and other features if relevant). The pages should appear consistent in terms of look-and-feel.

The page will be graded in Chrome (both browser AND "device" mode) with testing in viewport widths ranging between 320px (minimum) to 1200px (though it should obviously scale higher). The site must be well structured when tested within all viewport sizes. Content should remain fluid and fill the entire width of the viewport for small screens, and should be managed to best represent the content for larger screens (meaning fluid, or contained widths - depending on what's most appropriate given the content/layout)
